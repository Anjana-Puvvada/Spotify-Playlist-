# SPOTIFY Playlist Data Processing

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for the project "Spotify Playlist Data Processing," which was completed as part of IST652 - Scripting for Data Analysis. The project focuses on extracting, processing, and analyzing Spotify playlist data using the Spotify API. The aim is to derive meaningful insights into playlist characteristics, such as track duration, popularity, and release year distribution, through statistical analysis and visualization.

## Key Features
- **Data Extraction**: Utilizes the Spotify Web API to fetch playlist data in JSON format.
- **Data Processing**: Includes parsing, cleaning, and normalizing the JSON data to make it suitable for analysis.
- **Data Analysis**: Employs statistical methods to analyze playlist characteristics, including track duration, popularity, and release year distribution.
- **Visualization**: Generates charts and graphs to visually represent the insights derived from the data.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Spotify API
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- JSON

## Usage
1. **Setup**: Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.
2. **API Credentials**: Obtain Spotify API credentials and update the script with your client ID and client secret.
3. **Run Script**: Execute the data extraction and processing script to fetch and analyze the Spotify playlist data.
4. **View Results**: Review the generated charts and summaries to understand the insights from the analysis.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of API integration and data analysis to extract valuable insights from music playlist data, providing a foundation for data-driven decision-making in music content curation and playlist optimization.
